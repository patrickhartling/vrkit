/** \class Proxy Proxy.h vrkit/signal/Proxy.h
 *
 * Simple proxy for \c boost::signal<> instances that exposes only the
 * connect() member function. This allows for a (somewhat) cleaner interface
 * to accessing a \c boost::signal<> instance that is a class data member
 * without making that data member public. It is intended to be used for cases
 * when external classes need to connect a slot to a signal but the emitting
 * of the signal can only be performed by the holding class implementation.
 *
 * The idea for this class comes from the following article about signals and
 * slots:
 *
 * http://www.scottcollins.net/articles/a-deeper-look-at-signals-and-slots.html
 *
 * @note This class was renamed from vrkit::SignalProxy and moved into the
 *       vrkit::signal namespace in version 0.47.
 *
 * @since 0.24.1
