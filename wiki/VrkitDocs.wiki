At the moment, vrkit lacks formal documentation. As with many open source projects, the code offers the best documentation. Nevertheless, a user's guide is being written and will be published soon. Additional, more focused documentation is available on this wiki covering the following topics:

 * ApplicationUsage -- Instructions on how to use `vrkit_app` and `slaveViewer`. Refer to the ''User's Guide'' for more details.
 * API Reference -- Rendered C++ API documentation
