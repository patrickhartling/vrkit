                    classes.
                    -- VERSION -- 0.42.0
2007-08-04 patrick  Removed the implicit conversion to bool for

2007-07-31 patrick  inf::plugin::buildSearchPath() now looks in the "debug"
                    subdirectory for optimized and debug-enabled builds. For a
                    debug-enabled build, it looks in the "debug" subdirectory
                    first; for an optimized build, second.
                    inf::PluginRegistry::addEntry() now ignores duplicate entry

2007-07-17 patrick  Changed the Mode Harness Plug-in slot signature from
                    void (const std::string&) to void ().
2007-07-16 patrick  Reimplemented plug-in handling to support dependency
                    management and versioning. Replaced inf::PluginFactory

2007-07-13 patrick  Separated the Intersect Strategy plug-ins from the Grab
                    and Move Strategy plug-ins in the IOV installation tree.
2007-07-12 patrick  For debug builds, do not put "_d" in the plug-in name. The
                    debug-enabled plug-ins (not linked against the debug
                    runtime on Windows) are installed in the 'debug'
                    subdirectory of the directory containing the optimized
                    plug-ins. This is in line with changes in naming convention
                    in VR Juggler 2.2, though this change does not make VR
                    Juggler 2.2 the minimum required version.

2006-10-30 patrick  Introduced the Simple Slide Move Strategy as an alternative
                    to the (currently broken) Slide Move Strategy.
2006-10-25 patrick  Introduced inf::HighlightCoreFinder to give external code
                    access to the mechanism used by
                    inf::GeometryHighlightTraverser to find node cores that
                    can handle materials.
2006-09-30 patrick  IOV 0.32 branch created.
                    -- VERSION -- 0.33.0

                    Harness Plug-in until a component is available to be
                    activated by emitting the signal.
                    -- VERSION -- 0.32.2
2006-08-09 patrick  To build IOV with GCC 4.1 or newer, Boost 1.34 or newer is

                    -- VERSION -- 0.32.0
2006-07-10 patrick  Refactored inf::GrabPlugin and inf::GrabStrategy so that
                    inf::GrabPlugin now relies upon its grab strategy to keep
                    track of which objects are currently grabbed. Added an
                    "asynchronous" release signal to inf::GrabSignalData.

                    -- VERSION -- 0.30.4
2006-06-23 patrick  Added a signal-based grab strategy that leaves the
                    decisions about choosing objects and grabbing & releasing
                    them up to external code. External code hooks up to this
                    strategy plug-in through inf::GrabSignalData.

                    volumes.
2006-06-17 patrick  Extended the inf::Plugin interface to include methods for
                    context-specific actions (including rendering).

                    -- VERSION -- 0.28.0
2006-06-17 patrick  Merged inf::Plugin::updateState() and inf::Plugin::run()

2006-04-03 patrick  Moved the use of inf::GeometryHighlightTraverser out of the
                    Grab Plug-in and into the new class inf::BasicHighlighter.

2005-12-23 patrick  Added an overload of inf::Scene::getSceneData<T>() that
